/*! \brief Main class for interfacing with the A-Star 32U4 LCD.
 *
 * This class interfaces with an HD44780-compatible LCD connected to the LCD
 * connector on the A-Star 32U4 Prime.
 *
 * This library is similar to the Arduino
 * [LiquidCrystal library](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal),
 * but it has some extra features needed on the A-Star 32U4 Prime:
 *
 * * This class disables USB interrupts temporarily while writing to the LCD so
 *   that the USB interrupts will not change the RXLED and TXLED pins, which
 *   double as LCD data lines.
 * * This class disables the AVR's hardware SPI module temporarily so that
 *   it can use the PB3/MISO/DB4 pin as an output to control the LCD.
 * * This class restores the RS, DB4, DB5, DB6, and DB7 pins to their previous
 *   states when it is done using them so that those pins can also be used for
 *   other purposes such as controlling LEDs.
 *
 * This class assumes that you are using the default pin mapping that you would
 * get by simply connecting an LCD to the 2x7 LCD connector on the A-Star 32U4
 * Prime:
 *
 * * RS = Pin 7 (PE6)
 * * E = Pin 8 (PB4)
 * * DB4 = Pin 14 (PB3/MISO)
 * * DB5 = Pin 17 (PB0/SS/RXLED)
 * * DB6 = Pin 13 (PC7)
 * * DB7 = PD5/TXLED (which has no official pin number)
 *
 * If you want to control your LCD with different pins, you can edit the line
 * labeled "Pin assignments" in AStar32U4PrimeLCD.h or you can make your own new
 * LCD class in your sketch by copying the code for the AStar32U4PrimeLCD class,
 * which is not very long.
 *
 * This class inherits from the Arduino Print class, so you can call the
 * `print()` function on it with a variety of arguments.  See the
 * [Arduino print() documentation](http://arduino.cc/en/Serial/Print)
 * for more information.
 *
 * For detailed information about HD44780 LCD interface, including what
 * characters can be displayed, see the
 * [HD44780 datasheet](http://www.pololu.com/file/0J72/HD44780.pdf).
