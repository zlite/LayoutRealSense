/*! \brief Interfaces with button A.
 *
 * The pin used for button A is also used for reading the DO pin on the microSD
 * card on the A-Star 32U4 Prime.  If the chip select (CS) pin for the microSD
 * card is low (active), you cannot read button A because the signal from the
 * microSD card will override the signal from the button.  Therefore, the CS pin
 * needs to be high whenever functions in this class are called.  The CS pin is
 * high by default and the Arduino's SD library leaves CS high when the microSD
 * card is not being used, so most users will not need to worry about that. */

 * This class temporarily disables the AVR's hardware SPI module because it
 * might have been enabled by the Arduino's SD library, and the pin for button C
 * is the SPI SS line.  If it is an input and it reads low, the state of the SPI
 * module will be changed.
