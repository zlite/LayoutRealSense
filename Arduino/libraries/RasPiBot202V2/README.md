## Summary
This library is a work in progress and is the second generation of my RasPiBot202 robot. The first generation library, [DrGFreeman/RasPiBot202](https://github.com/DrGFreeman/RasPiBot202), remains available for reference but will not be developed further.

This new library aims at improving the performance of the control system by transferring more of the low-level, timing sensitive duties such as odometry and motor PID controls from the Raspberry Pi to the A-Star 32U4 microcontroller.

## Dependencies
